Not just an other HTML5 player extension.
This extension, unlike other extensions, will replace some video streaming sites
video player by Firefox native player. No just replacing Flash player by the
site HTML5 player version, but, booth the site HTML5 and Flash player with Firefox
native player.

**NOTE:**
This extension will change the page content of the supported video streaming
sites, as a result, many extensions that depends on this content will no longer
work as expected.
